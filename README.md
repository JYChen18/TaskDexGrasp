[IROS 2024] Task-Oriented Dexterous Hand Pose Synthesis Using Differentiable Grasp Wrench Boundary Estimator

[Project page](https://pku-epic.github.io/TaskDexGrasp/), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13586)

This repository only contains a minimal example for the grasp wrench boundary estimation and task-oriented loss calculation. 

The complete optimization pipeline to synthesize grasps will be released later (maybe after several months).


## Installation
